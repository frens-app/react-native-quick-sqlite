The original version of this repository has been moved to [margelo/react-native-quick-sqlite](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-sqlite)

I have created however a new package: [op-sqlite](https://github.com/OP-Engineering/op-sqlite). It is orders of magnitude faster when loading data and consumes much less memory. Margelo still owns quick-sqlite but I've moved on to op-sqlite.
